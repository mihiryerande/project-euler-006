# Problem 6:
#     Sum Square Difference
#
# Description:
#     The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is:
#         1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
#     The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is:
#         (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 3025
#
#     Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers
#       and the square of the sum is:
#         3025 - 385 = 2640
#
#     Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers
#       and the square of the sum.
